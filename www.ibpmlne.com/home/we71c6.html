                      <strong>Last updated May 2014<br />
                      <br />
                      </strong><strong class="bolder">1. &nbsp;Introduction</strong><br />
1.1 The BPM includes &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo; and a number of other   companies using brands including BPM,  and their associated companies. More information on the BPM can be found at www.rbssb.com.<br />
1.2&nbsp;Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how we use and protect   the information that you provide to us through the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;.<br />
1.3&nbsp;By accessing any part of this Website or providing any information   to us you consent to the use and transfer of your information on the   terms set out in this Privacy Policy.<br />
1.4&nbsp;We reserve the right to revise or supplement this Privacy Policy   from time to time at our sole discretion and you agree to revisit this   page regularly to ensure that you are familiar with the most current   version. By continuing to access or use the Website you will be agreeing   to any such changes.<br />
1.5&nbsp;If you are a customer of a BPM company, details of   the information we collect and how we use it will also be set out in the   terms and conditions of the product or service which you hold. In the   event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the terms and   conditions of your specific product or service, the terms and conditions   of your specific product or service will take precedence.<br />
<br />
<strong class="bolder">2.   &nbsp;Information we collect from you</strong><br />
2.1&nbsp;In general you can visit this Website without telling us who you are   or revealing any information about yourself. However, there are parts   of this Website where we may need to collect personal information from   you, including without limitation your name, post and email addresses,   fax and telephone numbers, employment details, date of birth and banking   details.<br />
<br />
<strong class="bolder">3.&nbsp;Use of information collected</strong><br />
3.1&nbsp;Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally   identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits,   average time spent on the Website, pages viewed etc. We use this   information to measure the use of our Website and to improve its   contents.<br />
3.2&nbsp;When other personal information, such as your name and email address   is collected from you (for example through online forms or via email   etc) we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use   that personal information. We may also use the personal information you   provide or which we collect via this Website for the purposes of:<br />
(i)&nbsp;providing you with services which you have requested and notifying   you about important changes or developments to these services;<br />
(ii)&nbsp;updating our records about you;<br />
(iii)&nbsp;crime detection, prevention and prosecution;<br />
(iv)&nbsp;responding to your inquiries and complaints or to process your   requests in relation to your information;<br />
(v)&nbsp;administering offers, competitions and other promotions;<br />
(vi) &nbsp;evaluating the effectiveness of our marketing and for research,   training and statistical analysis with the aim of improving our   services; and<br />
(vii) &nbsp;making the Website easier for you to use and providing you with   access to certain parts of the Website.<br />
3.2&nbsp;We may also contact you about products and services available from   BPM, and from selected companies outside the   group, which we believe may interest you or benefit you financially. We   may do this by post or by phone unless you have told us not to; and by   email, text or other electronic means if you have told us that we can or   as otherwise allowed by law. You may tell us at any time if you change   your mind. For more information on your marketing preferences please   visit&nbsp;Your marketing preferences.<br />
3.3&nbsp;BPM will treat your personal information   as confidential but may share it with each other and disclose it outside   the BPM if:&nbsp;<br />
&bull;&nbsp;you consent;<br />
&bull;&nbsp;it is needed by our agents, advisors or others involved in running   accounts and services for you or collecting what you owe BPM ;<br />
&bull;&nbsp;HM Revenue &amp; Customs or other authorities require it;<br />
&bull;&nbsp;the law or public interest permits or requires it;<br />
&bull;&nbsp;required by us or others to investigate or prevent crime;<br />
&bull;&nbsp;we need to provide it to a third party in anticipation of or following   a sale, merger of the whole or any part of the BPM or in the course of a joint venture. &nbsp;<br />
3.4&nbsp;All countries in the Asian Economic Area (including the UK) have   similar standards of legal protection for your personal information.   BPM may run your accounts and provide other   services from centres outside the Asian Economic Area (such as the   USA and India) that do not have the same standard of data protection   laws as the UK. However, if we do, we will always have a contract in   place to ensure that your personal information is protected at least to   UK standards, and we will remain bound by our obligations under the Data   Protection Act 1998.&nbsp;<br />
3.6&nbsp;We may monitor, record, store and use any telephone, email or other   communications we have with you for training purposes, so that we can   check any instructions given to us, for crime prevention and to improve   the quality of our customer service.<br />
3.7&nbsp;By using the Website you consent to us using your personal   information for the purposes described above.<br />
<br />
<strong class="bolder">4.&nbsp;Use of   cookies</strong><br />
4.1&nbsp;Cookies are small amounts of information that are stored on your   computer to enable our server to collect certain information from your   web browser. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual, just   the computer used. Cookies and other similar technology make it easier   for you to log on to and use the Website during future visits.<br />
4.2&nbsp;Cookies are used in this Website by us and by third parties to:<br />
&bull;&nbsp;monitor and manage Website traffic;<br />

4.3&nbsp;Cookies themselves only record which areas of the Website have been   visited by the computer in question, and for how long.
